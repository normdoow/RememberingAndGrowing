Rather than stand by a good leader we are quick to put down, criticize and find fault. No one is ever good enough to be offered our full loyalty and support. On the other hand, the leaders can be the issue as well. Some leaders think they own the world and their pride creates problems. How can you apply the Bible�s many examples of leadership? When do the following words make sense? Subdue, manage, direct, inspire, create, accomplish, improve, discover, learn and grow. What does this look like in me?"

You could talk forever about this guy and his commitment to God. Notice the cool transition to another man of God, Elisha. Let�s consider God�s sovereignty for a bit. A prophet tells Ahab some bad news. So Ahab decides to trick God and the prophet while believing he can overcome the prophecy. No chance!
